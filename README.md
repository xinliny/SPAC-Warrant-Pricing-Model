# SPAC-Warrant-Pricing-Model

Collaborating Company: AQR Arbitrage

Academic Supervisor: Prof. Mikhail Chernov

## Project Goal
1. Build a pricing model for SPAC warrant using warrant pricing models in existing literature.
2. Construct a warrant trading strategy based on the best-performing pricing model; Develop trading strategies using market trend signals.
3. Conduct back-tests using historical SPAC warrant pricing data.

## Project Conclusion
1. The best-performing pricing model for SPAC warrant is Diluted Black-Scholes Model.
2. To trade SPAC warrants, the simple buy-and-hold SPAC trading strategy performs well. However, combining the pricing model with the market trends signals generates the highest returns.
3. Our analysis raises questions for future research in warrant/option asset pricing. First, it would be useful to incorporate open interest into the pricing model of SPAC warrants if data is available. At present, open interest data for SPAC warrants is not available before or after the acquisition. Alternatively, the trading volume for SPAC warrants may be used as an indicator for SPAC open interest after the SPAC acquisition. Second, it would be innovative to incorporate demand and supply into the pricing of other assets which have a market trend.
